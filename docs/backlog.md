# Project Backlog

> ⚠️ **HARD LIMIT: this file holds ACTIVE state only (~80 lines).** Historical ledger → [`docs/backlog-archive.md`](backlog-archive.md); full per-task detail → `docs/sessions/`.
> "Last Session" = 2–4 lines. When a task is reviewed/closed, move it to ONE row at the TOP of the archive ledger. See `docs/ai-behavior.md` → "Backlog & Session Log Rules".
> Reconciled against git history 2026-07-17 (`main` == `origin/main`): everything committed is pushed. The former per-task "pending owner run" narrative was stale (its detail already lives in the archive) and has been removed.

## Last Session (2026-07-17)

- **Task 620** — `theme.ts` badge shade-index comments corrected to index 7 (comment-only, zero pixel change; mechanism verified against Mantine `get-primary-shade.mjs`/`get-css-color-variables.mjs`). ✅ APPROVED (orchestrator review) + committed + pushed. Open P3 follow-ups: light-mode qualifier on the new comments, `purple` index-0 comment still imprecise, stale `sale` prose. Session: `docs/sessions/2026-07-17-task620-badge-shade-comment-accuracy.md`.
- **Task 619** — dedicated `sale` `#dd0939` badge color (index 7 per `primaryShade:7`, card + detail surfaces). ✅ APPROVED + committed + pushed.
- **Tasks 614–618** — Sprint 44 listing card/detail Mantine tail (`ListingDetailPattern` rebuild, premium uniform gold border, Badge→Mantine `filled`, CTA flex-direction fix, check-stories Check-9 proof). ✅ all committed + pushed.
- **Governance** — added the STATUS/REPORT MISMATCH reconciliation gate (`CLAUDE.md` + `agent-contract.md` + `orchestrator-role.md` + `orchestrator-procedures.md`).

## Open — needs action

**Not yet executed / re-scope before kicking off:**
- **Task 610** — grid/list title-hover asymmetry. No commits; likely a no-op after Task 608 shipped the grid `group-hover` fix — verify/re-scope first.
- **Task 613** — remove the DEAD `--z-*` Tailwind z-index token scale (`globals.css`; Tailwind v4 never compiles it into `z-*` utilities). Kickoff open, not executed; LOW priority. Kickoff `..._Task_613_DeadZIndexTokenScaleCleanup.md`.

**Deferred / on hold:**
- **Task 560** — admin suspension-as-date-range (DB/RLS/server action). Deferred.
- **Task 463** (Epic BB) — full admin report management. ON HOLD until the Mantine primitive library (Epic MM) is complete; must be rebuilt on finished primitives. Kickoff `tasks/Epics/Epic_BB_kickoff_prompt_Task_463_AdminReportFullManagement.md`.
- **Epic HH** — 310 (P4 content/settings routes), 311 (P5 modal standardisation, partial), 313 (P6 Verified Agents, blocked on owner DB-schema sign-off); 308/309 re-scope onto canonical primitives.
- **Task 453** (Epic KK.2) — remaining admin-manager freshness. Reserved.

## Pending Action Items (owner)

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| 🔐 Re-verify HIBP "leaked password protection" availability on Supabase Free tier (Auth → Password Security); enable now if available, else at Pro upgrade. | Security Advisor `auth_leaked_password_protection` WARN. `docs/integrations.md`. |
| 👁️ Eyeball-verify notification localization under `/sq` (data-only fix applied 2026-07-14; creation code already correct). | Re-open the bell under `/sq`. |
| 🐞 `/listings` Grid horizontal overflow <640px (FilterBar segmented `flex-1` + `min-w-35` Combobox push `scrollWidth` past the viewport at 320/375/390). Needs its own task. | Traced via DOM offender scan; out of Task 603 scope. |
| 🖋️ Verified Agents DB schema sign-off (Task 313) + verified-badge public visibility. | Epic HH blocker. |

**Task numbering — last used: 620. Next free: 621.**

## Standing notes

> **Frozen/deferred (reviewed 2026-06-05):** Sprint 28 admin-mobile 308/309 must be re-scoped onto the DS + canonical primitives before resuming; Epic HH P4/P5/P6 per the table above; I.3 deferred (valid). Every open task consumes the global Design System (`docs/design-system.md`, Task 340) wherever UI/responsive/overlay is touched, and since the Mantine freeze (Task 482) new UI uses Mantine (`docs/mantine-responsive-design-system.md`); `docs/rule-index.md` sets the per-task pre-read.

> **🟡 Console NOISE (not bugs — do not re-triage as P0):** `[PRED] … preloaded`, `[LCP] … route`, `[Vercel Speed Insights] debug`, "speculation rule set … will be ignored", Turbopack dev-only CSS-chunk/`*.woff2` preload warnings — all dev/debug artifacts, gone in prod. OpenTelemetry `import-in-the-middle` resolved by Task 450 (`322c5d599`); Cloudinary LCP "preloaded but not used" by Task 437. A stale Turbopack `next dev` HMR cache can emit a one-off React `useId` `mantine-_R_…-target` hydration error that does NOT survive a clean `next build` + fresh dev restart and does NOT reproduce in prod — re-verify with `check:hydration` against a freshly restarted server before triaging any `_R_` id mismatch as a code bug (Task 582).

> **Commit emission policy:** the orchestrator emits explicit-path `git add`/`git commit` per task at review time (never `-A`/`-u`/wildcards, never pre-staged batches); the owner runs them in PowerShell. Before emitting, reconcile `git status --short` + the real diff + the session `Files Changed` table (STATUS/REPORT MISMATCH gate). Each commit is reconstructable from the session log.

> **Acknowledged advisor exceptions** (intentional, no task): `pg_net in public` (deferred); `email_change_tokens` RLS-enabled-no-policy — see `docs/rls-rules.md` → "Acknowledged Advisor Exceptions".

> **Standing governance:** `ai-behavior.md` Notes 18–23 + `agent-contract.md` (P0, clauses 1–15) + `rule-index.md` (task-type pre-reads) + the Positive/Negative flow rule (`orchestrator-role.md`). Non-optional acceptance gates on every task.
